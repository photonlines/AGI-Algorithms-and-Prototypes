# AGI Algorithms and Prototypes 

This repository contains what I believe to be important algorithms in regard to
reaching an AGI (Advanced Generalized Intelligence).

Most of the code here is for educational purposes. I'll also be including write-ups 
on my blog which explain exactly why and how these algorithms work - as well as 
more info and general ideas on how they could be used in constructing an AGI agent. 

Eventually, I'm hoping to attempt to create my own AGI agent or agent prototypes and 
mini-implementations of various ML techniques and algorithms which will attempt to
reach a more advanced 'intelligence level.'
